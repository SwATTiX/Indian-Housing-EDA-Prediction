# Housing Prices in Six Indian Metropolitan Cities
#### Developed by Swattik Kundu, Computer Science Student of UEMK!

This project deals with Exploratory Data Analysis and Predicting the price of houses in the Indian Metropolitian Cities of Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai using regression models of:
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression of degree = 2 (Optional)*
3. Decision Tree Regression
4. Random Forest Regression
5. Support Vector Regression
6. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

It is divided into two modules based on two different approaches implemented:
1. Approach 1 - Dropping the missing values
2. Approach 2(Optional)** - Taking the features with non-missing values only


*It is found Polymomial Regression behaves abnormally as compared to others after execution. It is better to leave it out and is thus commented out!

**Approach 2 is optional. It is there just to learn and explore a different approach to see how the performance and data analysis get affected.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/housing-prices-in-metropolitan-areas-of-india/code?datasetId=846956&sortBy=voteCount

P.S. - I am a beginner and would appreciate any recommendations, thoughts and advise.
